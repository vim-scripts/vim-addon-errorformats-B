Advanced features such as \\\"run in background\\\" require errorformats, too. Vim only has :compiler, which also sets makeprg etc, which is not what you want in some cases.

This plugin provides errorformats only for various compilers etc.

Best is that you can combine multiple errorformats, such as ruby (rumake build system) & target language (ocaml)
